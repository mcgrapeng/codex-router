## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex Router

Install globally with your preferred package manager:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @zhang3f/codexrouter
```

Then simply run `coder` to get started. The npm package creates and uses
only `~/.codexrouter` by default so it stays isolated from any existing
`~/.codex` CLI configuration.

<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.
